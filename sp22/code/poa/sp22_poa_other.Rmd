1.	Find proportion of people who gave a high rating to State & Federal Government [31]
a.	Find subset of population who have above median income [13]
b.	Compare the groups below and above median income groups on the basis of their participation in political advocacy.

```{r}
wrangled %>% summarize(across(contains("inc_ab_med"), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
make_plots(wrangled, c("inc_ab_med_before", "inc_ab_med_after", "inc_ab_med"), "rate_gov_all_good", title = "Rated Government Well", show = TRUE)
```

# 8.2)People with below median income were more likely to give low ratings to the responses of dr State & Federal Government 

1.Find proportion of people who gave a low rating to State & Federal Government [31]
a.	Find subset of population who have below median income [13]
b.	Compare the groups below and above median income groups on the basis on their participation in political advocacy.

```{r}
wrangled %>% summarize(across(contains("inc_be_med"), mean, na.rm = TRUE))

make_plots(wrangled, "inc_be_med", "rate_gov_all_bad", title = "Rated Government (Very) Poorly")
```

# 8.3)Find source of aid for all these requirements[33]

```{r}
wrangled %>% select(starts_with("lr_"))

wrangled %>% mutate(across(starts_with("lr_") & is.labelled, as.integer)) %>%
  pivot_longer(is.integer & starts_with("lr_")) %>%
  select(name,value) %>%
  mutate(name = str_replace(name, "lr_", "")) %>%
  filter(str_detect(name, "_")) %>%
  separate(name, into = c("area", "resource")) %>%
  group_by(area, resource) %>%
  summarize(n = sum(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  group_by(area) %>% #mutate(denom = sum(n)) %>%
  arrange(area, desc(n)) %>%
  #filter(row_number() <= 1) #%>%
  ungroup() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = area, y = resource)) + geom_point()
